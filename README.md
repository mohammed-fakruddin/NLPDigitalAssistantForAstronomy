# Objectives
It was April 2019, peak Indian summer, I took my family to a 3 nights astronomy & night sky star gazing holidays in remote holiday resort in the Kavalur forest region of Tamil Nadu state. We stayed in a small holiday resort which is very popular amongst keen astronomers because the resort has a powerful electronic telescope for night sky star gazing. For first time my life I seen all three big planets: MARS, Jupiter and Saturn. It was a thrilling experience to me and to my family which spurred interest in the Astronomy.
